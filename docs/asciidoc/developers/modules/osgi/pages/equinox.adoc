= Equinox

== Overview

http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/[Equinox] is considered to be a reference implementation of the  https://osgi.org/download/r7/osgi.core-7.0.0.pdf[OSGi Core Release 7].
It is an http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/[open source project], part of the https://eclipse.org/eclipse/[Eclipse project].
It provides a set of bundles, that implement various optional OSGi services.

The _OpenSmartHouse_ bundles are deployed on an Equinox runtime.
Knowledge about how to start the runtime and execute basic commands will help you to speedup the development process.

== Start Equinox Runtime from Eclipse

1. Go to "Run" -> "Run Configurations".
2. From the list in the left panel choose "OSGi Framework". Right click on it and choose "New".
3. After you've been created a new configuration, select the bundles that you need from the workspace.
4. Then make sure that the following bundles from the target platform are selected, otherwise the OSGi console will not be available:

    org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime
    org.apache.felix.gogo.shell
    org.apache.felix.gogo.command
    org.eclipse.equinox.console

5. Click on "Add Required Bundles". Eclipse will resolve all dependencies of the bundles listed above and include new bundles to the configuration.
6. Click on "Validate Bundles" and make sure that "No problems were detected" is displayed.
7. You can start Equinox with the "Run" button.

== Run Equinox from the command line

The *org.eclipse.osgi* bundle is the framework implementation of the Core Framework specification in a standalone package.

If you have compiled _OpenSmartHouse_ once either via command line (`mvn install`) or the Eclipse IDE, maven will have downloaded Equinox for you already.
Find it in your maven cache directory (linux `~/.m2/repository/org/eclipse/platform/org.eclipse.osgi/3.15.0/org.eclipse.osgi-3.15.0.jar`
and windows `C:\Users\your.name\.m2\..`).

 1. Create `configuration` folder in that directory.
 2. Inside the `configuration` folder create a file `config.ini`.
 3. Save the following content in the `config.ini` file:

```ini
    osgi.bundles=\  
    org.eclipse.core.runtime,\  
    org.eclipse.equinox.common,\  
    org.eclipse.core.jobs,\  
    org.eclipse.equinox.registry,\  
    org.eclipse.equinox.preferences,\  
    org.eclipse.core.contenttype,\  
    org.eclipse.equinox.app,\  
    org.eclipse.equinox.console,\  
    org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime,\  
    org.apache.felix.gogo.shell,\  
    org.apache.felix.gogo.command  

    eclipse.ignoreApp=true  
    eclipse.consoleLog=true  
```

 4. Use the following command line to run Equinox:

```shell
java -jar org.eclipse.osgi-3.x.x.jar -console -configuration configuration
```

== Commands

Once you have Equinox running, you will see a prompt.
Some of the basic OSGi commands are:

|===
| Command   | Description  
| _help_    | Basic command that will list all available commands 
| _install_ [bundle URL]  | Installs the bundle from the given URL  
| _start_ [bundle # or bundle name] | Starts the bundle with the given numeric or symbolic id   
| _stop_ [bundle # or bundle name]  | Stops the bundle with the given numeric or symbolic id 
| _ss_                              | Reports a summary status of all installed bundles 
| _diag_ [bundle # or bundle name]  
    | Reports any resolution problems for the bundle with the given numeric or symbolic id  
| _services_ [filter] 
    | Lists all available services or only services matching to http://www.ldapexplorer.com/en/manual/109010000-ldap-filter-syntax.htm[LDAP-style filter] (e.g. services (objectClass="\*virtage*") - will print only services having _virtage_ in their class name)

== Equinox Bundles

Another part of the Equinox project is http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/bundles/[Equinox Bundles].
It consists of bundles that implement all add-on services from the OSGi specification and additional services defined in various OSGi expert groups.

Some of the core bundles are listed in the table below.
Some or all of these bundles must be included in your runtime configuration, if you want to use the services that they provide.

|===
| Name | Bundle Symbolic Name | Description
| Declarative Services | org.eclipse.equinox.ds 
    | An implementation of the OSGi xref:osgids.adoc[Declarative Services] specification
| Event Admin Service | org.eclipse.equinox.event | OSGi Compendium Release 7 https://osgi.org/javadoc/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/org/osgi/service/event/EventAdmin.php[Event Admin] Service provides an inter-bundle communication mechanism based on an event publish and subscribe model 
| Equinox Utilities | org.eclipse.equinox.util 
    | A library of utility classes that are frequently used from the Equinox OSGi Service implementation bundles
| OSGi Services API | org.eclipse.osgi.service | This bundle contains the set of OSGi specified service APIs
